# MontyCloud Customer Support Bot - FIXES APPLIED ✅

## 🔧 ISSUES FIXED:

### Issue 1: ❌ Two JIRA Tickets Being Created
**Problem**: Bot was creating CST-12 (main) + CST-13 (audit) tickets
**Root Cause**: Assistant was calling both main functions AND `update_jira` separately
**Solution**: ✅ Updated assistant instructions to specify "DO NOT call update_jira separately"

### Issue 2: ❌ Bot Still Asking for YYYY-MM-DD Format  
**Problem**: Despite natural language parsing being implemented, bot was still asking for strict format
**Root Cause**: Assistant instructions weren't updated to emphasize natural language acceptance
**Solution**: ✅ Updated assistant with clear instructions to accept natural language dates

## 🚀 CHANGES MADE:

### ✅ Updated Assistant Instructions:
1. **Single JIRA Ticket**: "Each main function automatically creates its own JIRA ticket - DO NOT call update_jira separately"
2. **Natural Language Emphasis**: "NEVER ask for YYYY-MM-DD format"
3. **Explicit Guidance**: "When users provide dates like '20th June 2025' or 'next month', accept them directly"

### ✅ Updated Function Descriptions:
- **extend_trial.end_date**: "Accepts natural language like '20th June 2025', 'June 20, 2025', 'next month', 'in 30 days'. Do NOT require YYYY-MM-DD format."
- **upgrade_subscription.effective_date**: Same natural language emphasis

### ✅ New Assistant Created:
- **Old Assistant ID**: `asst_hP1hBIZq0OyfqtyVPD5waCCh`
- **New Assistant ID**: `asst_Uzn9llSqEgi29Lx12IpEo86s`
- **Environment Updated**: `.env.local.user` updated with new assistant ID

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:

### ✅ Single JIRA Ticket:
- Only **one** ticket should be created per workflow (CST-X)
- No more duplicate audit tickets

### ✅ Natural Language Date Acceptance:
- User says: "20th June 2025" → Bot accepts directly
- User says: "next month" → Bot accepts directly  
- User says: "in 30 days" → Bot accepts directly
- Bot should **NEVER** ask for "YYYY-MM-DD format"

## 🧪 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:

### Test Case 1: Single Ticket Creation
```
Input: "upgrade abc@corp.com from trial to enterprise effective 20th June 2025"
Expected: Only ONE JIRA ticket created (e.g., CST-X)
```

### Test Case 2: Natural Language Date Acceptance
```
Input: "extend trial for user@company.com to next month"
Expected: Bot accepts "next month" without asking for YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Test Case 3: Various Date Formats
```
Test inputs:
- "20th June 2025"
- "June 20, 2025"
- "next month"
- "in 30 days"
- "tomorrow"

Expected: All accepted without format conversion requests
```

## 📋 RESTART REQUIRED:

**IMPORTANT**: Since the assistant ID has changed, you need to:
1. **Restart the bot application** for the new assistant to take effect
2. **Test the workflows** to confirm both issues are resolved

---

## 🎉 STATUS: READY FOR TESTING

Both issues have been addressed:
✅ **Single JIRA ticket creation**
✅ **Natural language date acceptance**

The bot should now work exactly as intended!
